       How to write captions and descriptive alt-text
    </h2>
    <h3> Photo captions </h3>
<p>The credits line should appear at the end of a caption, either in parentheses or in a different type (or both). A photographer’s name can also be put in small type parallel to the bottom or side of a photograph. </p>
<p>Photo order should be denoted in italics. i.e. Left to right: Louis Langree, Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, Joshua Bell Above: Joshua Bell Below: Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra Abbreviated version: l-r: Louis Langree, Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, Joshua Bell (en dash; lowercase) </p>
<h3>Alternative text </h3>
<p>Alt-text provides people with limited to no vision descriptions about what is on a web page. This text alternative to an image is an attribute within HTML that provides contextual descriptions of images or other media documents on a web page. All images on LCPA’s website will include descriptive alt-text, beginning with new events.</p>
<p> The alt-text attribute serves the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Allow people with low vision or who are blind to have a text-based representation of the image by providing words to screen readers </li>
  <li>Describe an image specific to its relation to the content on a web page. </li>
  <li>Allow search engines to properly index images. </li>
</ul>
  <h3>Descriptive Alt-Text Checklist: </h3>
	<ul>
  <li>Describe the information Consider information best for all readers (caption) and vital for people who are unable to see visual image (alt-text). </li>
  <li>Do not repeat content from caption in alt-text, or visa versa. </li>
  <li> Describe who or what is in the image. Be as precise and concise as possible. </li>
  <li> Only a few words are necessary, limiting your wording to 125 characters, or a short sentence or two. </li>
  <li> Do not use the words "image of ..." or "graphic of ..." to describe the image. Screen readers detect images and add those words before reading off the alt text. For example, if an image is of a red apple, and the alt text reads “Image of a red apple”, then the screen reader will read “Image of image of red apple.” </li>
  <li>All images, graphics and anything that goes in the image tag :&lt;img&gt; must have an alt= attribute. Describe the information that the image is conveying, not the picture.</li>
  <li> Active images require descriptive alt text, but static images don’t. </li>
  <li>Images that contain information require descriptive alt text, but images that are placeholders don’t.</li>
  <li> Logo’s can be described as: “XYZ Logo” </li>
		<li>Decorative images should have empty alt text. </li></ul>
  <p>Alt-text is an attribute of the image tag, and is usually written like this: Caption: Mrs. John B. Conners (left), Dr. Howard Rusk (center), and Miss Ruth Anderson(right), during a rehearsal in Philharmonic Hall (now David Geffen Hall). Descriptive Alt-text: &lt;img src=”conners-rusk-anderson.jpg” alt= “Mrs. John B. Conners and Miss Ruth Anderson are side-by-side in wheelchairs, while Dr. Howard Rusk, stands between them, resting his arms on their wheelchairs. All three people are smiling while dressed in formal attire. The photograph is in black and white.” /&gt; Source: Bette Knapp and the Pursuit of Inclusion. </p>

Conners and Miss Ruth Anderson are side-by-side in wheelchairs, while Dr. Howard Rusk, stands between them, resting his arms on their wheelchairs. All three people are smiling while dressed in formal attire. The photograph is in black and white."/>
 
<p>If the image is of a word, for example:</p>
  <img src="words.jpg" width="618" height="396" alt="Words collaborative, helpful, intelligent and friendly in larger font. Arrogant, dumb, rude, unfriendly in smaller font."/>
  
  <p> Caption: The power of words, where positive words are larger than negative words. Alt-text: &lt;img src=”collaborative-text.jpg” alt=” Words collaborative, helpful, intelligent and friendly in larger font. Arrogant, dumb, rude, unfriendly in smaller font.” /&gt;. If the image has complex information — such as charts or graphs — the image should have a short alt text to identify the image, and then the detailed description of the information should be provided elsewhere (for example, in a data table).
